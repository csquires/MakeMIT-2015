# Table 3rd (MakeMIT 2015)
A robotic bartender fueled by the Venmo API and pubsub in SpaceBrew.

This project was created for a 12-hour hackathon called MakeMIT. The goal of the project was to create a robotic bartender. The physical manifestation was a plexiglass table with an arm to deliver a drink to a particular location on the table. The software allowed for a customer to place an order by simply sending the table an appropriate amount of money and a comment via Venmo. When the Venmo API alerted the table of the order, an Arduino controlled the pouring and delivery of the drink to the location at the table.

Mechanically, the drink cup is actuated by two servos offering full motion in the plane of the table. An additional servo controls the flow of the drink into the cup by adding a kink to the siphon tube.
